# 🧠 What is Multimodal AI?

Multimodal AI refers to systems that can understand and process **multiple data modalities** simultaneously:

* Text
* Images
* Audio
* Video
* Documents
* Sensor signals

Goal:

```text
Different data types → Shared understanding → Unified reasoning
```

# 1️⃣ CLIP (Contrastive Language–Image Pretraining)

## What is CLIP?

CLIP is a **multimodal embedding model** developed by OpenAI that maps **images and text into the same semantic vector space**.

```text
Image → Vector
Text  → Vector
Similarity(Image, Text) → Semantic Match
```

---

## Architecture

```text
Image → Vision Encoder (ViT/ResNet)
Text  → Text Encoder (Transformer)

        ↓
Shared Embedding Space
```

Training uses **contrastive learning**:

* Match correct image‑caption pairs
* Push incorrect pairs apart

---

## Capabilities

* Zero‑shot classification
* Cross‑modal retrieval
* Image search via text

---

## Role in Multimodal RAG

```text
Image → CLIP embedding
Query → CLIP embedding
Vector search → Retrieve images
```

CLIP does **NOT generate text**.

---

## Summary

| Feature        | Value           |
| -------------- | --------------- |
| Type           | Embedding Model |
| Generates Text | ❌ No            |
| Retrieval      | ✅ Excellent     |
| Shared Space   | ✅ Yes           |
| RAG Role       | Retriever       |

# 2️⃣ BLIP (Bootstrapping Language–Image Pretraining)

## What is BLIP?

BLIP is a **vision‑language generation model** capable of understanding images and generating natural language descriptions.

Unlike CLIP, BLIP can **produce text outputs**.

---

## Architecture

```text
Vision Encoder + Text Encoder + Text Decoder
```

---

## Key Idea — Caption Bootstrapping

BLIP automatically generates captions and improves training quality using self‑generated annotations.

---

## Example

```text
Input Image → "A man riding a bicycle on a city street."
```

---

## Role in Multimodal RAG

Used for **Image → Text conversion**.

```text
Image
 ↓
BLIP Caption
 ↓
Text Embedding
 ↓
Vector Database
```

This is called **Caption‑Based Multimodal RAG**.

---

## Summary

| Feature    | Value                  |
| ---------- | ---------------------- |
| Captioning | ✅ Yes                  |
| Generation | ✅ Yes                  |
| Embeddings | ✅ Yes                  |
| RAG Role   | Image → Text Converter |

---

# 3️⃣ BLIP‑2

## What is BLIP‑2?

BLIP‑2 efficiently connects **vision models with large language models (LLMs)** without expensive joint training.

---

## Core Problem Solved

Training multimodal LLMs from scratch is extremely expensive.

BLIP‑2 freezes large models and trains only a lightweight bridge.

---

## Architecture

```text
Image → Frozen Vision Encoder
            ↓
          Q‑Former
            ↓
        Frozen LLM
            ↓
         Text Output
```

### Q‑Former

A transformer that converts visual features into language‑compatible tokens.

---

## Advantages

* Efficient training
* Scalable
* Reuses pretrained LLMs

---

## Role in Multimodal RAG

Used during **generation stage** for reasoning over retrieved images.

---

## Summary

| Feature             | Value     |
| ------------------- | --------- |
| Vision + LLM Bridge | ✅ Yes     |
| Efficient Training  | ✅ Yes     |
| Caption Quality     | High      |
| RAG Role            | Generator |

---

# 4️⃣ ImageBind (Meta)

## What is ImageBind?

ImageBind learns a **single embedding space across many modalities**, not just image and text.

Supported modalities:

* Images
* Text
* Audio
* Video
* Depth
* Thermal
* IMU signals

---

## Concept

```text
Dog image
Dog bark audio
Text "dog"
Dog video

→ Same embedding region
```

Images act as the binding anchor modality.

---

## Role in Multimodal RAG

Ideal for systems involving:

* Audio archives
* Video retrieval
* Sensor datasets

---

## Summary

# 5️⃣ SigLIP (Sigmoid Loss Image Pretraining)

## What is SigLIP?

SigLIP is a **CLIP‑style embedding model** introduced by Google using **sigmoid loss instead of softmax contrastive loss**.

---

## Why It Matters

CLIP requires large batch negatives.

SigLIP learns independently per image‑text pair:

```text
More stable training
Better scaling
Stronger retrieval performance
```

---

## Role in Multimodal RAG

Drop‑in replacement for CLIP embeddings with improved retrieval quality.

---

## Summary
