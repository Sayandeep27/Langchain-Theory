# 1. What is Regular RAG?

Retrieval‑Augmented Generation (RAG) improves LLM answers by grounding them in external data.

## Problem

LLMs may hallucinate because they rely only on learned knowledge.

## Solution — RAG

RAG works like an **open‑book exam**:

1. Search documents
2. Retrieve relevant chunks
3. Provide them as context to an LLM
4. Generate grounded answers

### Basic Flow

```

Answer
```

## Limitation

Regular RAG understands **TEXT ONLY**.

It cannot interpret:

* Charts
* Diagrams
* Images
* Tables visually

---

# 2. Why Do We Need Multimodal RAG?

Real documents contain visual information.

| Document Type       | Visual Element      |
| ------------------- | ------------------- |
| Financial Reports   | Graphs & dashboards |
| Medical Records     | X‑rays & scans      |
| Engineering Manuals | Assembly diagrams   |
| Research Papers     | Figures & plots     |

Ignoring visuals means losing critical information.

## Multimodal RAG

Allows reasoning over:

* Text
* Images
* Charts
* Tables
* Layouts

Together.

---

# 3. Multimodal RAG Pipeline (Step‑by‑Step)

## Stage 1 — Input Documents

Supported inputs:

* PDFs
* Images
* Slides
* Videos

---

## Stage 2 — Parsing & Modality Separation

Documents are decomposed into:

* Text chunks
* Images
* Tables
* Metadata

**Tools:**

* PyMuPDF
* Unstructured.io

---

## Stage 3 — Multimodal Embeddings

A **vector embedding** converts meaning into numbers.

Key insight:

> An image of a cat and the text "a cat" produce nearby vectors.

### Models

* CLIP
* ImageBind
* SigLIP

---

## Stage 4 — Vector Database Storage

Stored with metadata:

```
{
  embedding: [...],
  modality: "image",
  source: "page_5_chart.png"
}
```

Vector DB options:

* FAISS
* Pinecone
* Weaviate

---

## Stage 5 — Query Embedding

User query → embedding → similarity search.

---

## Stage 6 — Context Assembly

System gathers:

* Retrieved text
* Retrieved images

---

## Stage 7 — Multimodal Generation

Models:

* GPT‑4V
* LLaVA
* Gemini Vision

Input:

```
Question + Text + Images
```

Output: grounded multimodal answer.

# 4. The Three Ways to Build Multimodal RAG

There is **no single architecture**. Choice depends on cost, accuracy, and scale.

---

## Option 1 — Full Multimodal (Most Powerful)

### Core Idea

Images remain images throughout the pipeline.

### Pipeline

1. Extract text & images
2. Create embeddings for BOTH
3. Store together along with metadata (like original text document link or image location)
4. Retrieve using multimodal similarity
5. Send retrived images + text to LLM (embedding was only for retrieval) - (since we have stored metadata : after retrieval, using those metadata who take the original text chunk and image and pass it to Multimodal LLM, we dont send embeddings)

### Retrieval Space

```
Text Meaning + Visual Meaning
```

### Example

Even if text never mentions a spike, the system retrieves a chart showing it.

### Advantages

* Highest accuracy
* True visual reasoning
* No information loss

### Disadvantages

* Expensive
* Large storage
* Complex infrastructure

### Use Cases

* Medical imaging
* Scientific analysis
* Engineering inspection

---

## Option 2 — Convert Images to Text (Cheapest)

### Core Idea

Describe images once, then treat everything as text.

### Pipeline

1. Image → Caption
2. Store caption as text
3. Use normal text RAG

Example caption:

```
"Chart shows revenue decline in Q3 and recovery in Q4"
```

### Advantages

* Cheapest
* Simple implementation
* Fast retrieval

### Disadvantages

* Loss of visual details
* Spatial relationships disappear

### Analogy

Describing a painting over the phone.

---

## Option 3 — Hybrid (Industry Favorite)

### Core Idea

Use text for search and images for reasoning.

### Pipeline

1. Generate image summary
2. Store summary embedding
3. Keep image reference
4. Retrieve using text
5. Attach real image during generation

### Generation Input

```
Question + Text + Image Summary + Actual Image
```

### Advantages

* Strong accuracy
* Medium cost
* Scalable

### Disadvantages

* Metadata linking complexity

### Industry Reality

Most production systems use Hybrid.

---

# 5. Full Multimodal vs Hybrid (Deep Comparison)

## One‑Sentence Difference

* **Full Multimodal:** Images participate in retrieval.
* **Hybrid:** Images are used only after retrieval.

---

## Architecture Difference

### Full Multimodal

```
Vector DB:
[text embeddings + image embeddings]
```

Images are searchable directly.

---

### Hybrid

```
Vector DB:
[text embeddings only]
```

Images retrieved indirectly via captions.

---

## Example Question

"When did performance suddenly increase?"

| System          | Result                     |
| --------------- | -------------------------- |
| Full Multimodal | Retrieves chart directly   |
| Hybrid          | Depends on caption quality |

---

## Key Architectural Insight

Where does visual understanding happen?

| Approach        | Visual Understanding Stage |
| --------------- | -------------------------- |
| Full Multimodal | Retrieval + Generation     |
| Image→Text      | Preprocessing              |
| Hybrid          | Generation mainly          |

| Retrieval uses image embeddings | YES             | NO        |
| Uses captions                   | Optional        | Required  |
| Generation sees images          | YES             | YES       |
| Cost                            | High            | Medium    |
| Complexity                      | High            | Medium    |
| Industry adoption               | Specialized     | Very High |

# 8. Architecture Decision Rule (Golden Rule)

Ask:

> Can my system find an image even if no text describes it?

* YES → **Full Multimodal**
* NO → **Hybrid**

---

# 9. One‑Line Memory Tricks

* **Full Multimodal:** "Search WITH images."
* **Image → Text:** "Describe images once."
* **Hybrid:** "Search by text, reason with images."

---

# Key Takeaways

* Multimodal RAG extends RAG beyond text.
* Architecture choice defines performance and cost.
* Hybrid systems dominate real industry deployments.
* Retrieval design is the real differentiator.
